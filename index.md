I am [Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/) in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge where I am a member of the [Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics group](http://www.atm.damtp..cam.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on the large scale processes in the stratosphere. Some of my current interests include understanding the radiative and dynamical interactions taking place in the atmosphere, the chemical processes that affect stratospheric ozone and exploring the seasonal to decadal aspects of the circulation.
