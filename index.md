I am [NERC Independent Research Fellow](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/) in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge where I am a member of the [Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics group](http://www.atm.damtp..cam.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on the large scale processes in the stratosphere. Some of my current interests include understanding the radiative and dynamical interactions taking place in the atmosphere, the chemical processes that affect stratospheric ozone and exploring the seasonal to decadal aspects of the circulation.

I am interested in supervising Masters and PhD projects as well as summer students. Please get in touch to discuss various project ideas (or just to chat about the stratosphere!).
